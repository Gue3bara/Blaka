# Blaka

# Build

Black and Hollow are combined in the same source file, but they can't currently be generated by `fontmake` like that because they are not interpolatable which `fontmake` expects. To keep the single source file, make changes to the single source file and export the separate `.glyphs` temporary sources using the following script from within Glyphs.app:

```python
import os
for instance in Glyphs.font.instances:
	font = instance.interpolatedFont
	font.familyName += " " + instance.name
	font.instances[0].name = "Regular"
	font.save(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(Glyphs.font.filepath), "temp", font.familyName.replace(" ", "") + "-Regular.glyphs"))
print("done")
```
